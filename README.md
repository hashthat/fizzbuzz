#FizzBuzz
The purpose of fizzbuzz is to show some coding skills and that's exactlt what this assignment is all about.
I have worked with fizzbuzz before, and I've had an interview where I performed fizzbuzz as one of three coding challenges, and this specific challenge held a specific feature that created a level of difficulty on handling a number next to every single expression in the fizzbuzz methodolagy.

The Assignment || Rubrik
========================
Create a Python Tutorial application in Python on one or more Python commands used in the Python programming language or another subject of your choice.
Scope: In your Python Tutorial, you only need to include:

    At least one Python command. For example, the "print" command and how to use it.
    Add at least two variables holding different data types to your application.
    Add user Input/Output to your application.

Create a description at the top of your program to let the user know the purpose of your program and how to use it.
Ensure your output is formatted correctly so it is legible.
Over-comment your code. Comment on every line of your code, showing your understanding of what it does and your intent in the application. Over-commenting your code is one of the best-kept secrets to learning new programming skills!
Have fun and make it memorable. It is okay to have funny content. The more humor in your assignment, the easier it is for you to remember it.
You can make your program look at least like the Sample Tutorial program output below, or make yours look different by teaching a different Python Command, or make your tutorial on some other subject you like in life instead of Python.
